# Shiphero
Simple PHP Wrapper for the Shiphero API

## Introduction
This is a *bare-bones* wrapper for Shiphero's REST API. While fully capable of interacting with the Shiphero interface, please note
that most methods require multi-dimensional associative arrays that mimic the structure of the JSON objects that ultimately get passed
into cURL. 

This wrapper will handle all required cURL functions and JSON encoding/decoding. In the event that additional cURL options 
need to be modified, a method is provided to [accomodate this need](#setting-additional-curl-options).

To make a short story even shorter: [Look at Shiphero's API Documentation](http://docs.shipheropublic.apiary.io/#) in order to understand
how to structure your arrays and format your data. 

Examples are provided to assist you with understanding this wrapper, ***but it is no excuse for not understanding the actual API***.
